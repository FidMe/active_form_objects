Form objects are a great way to clean up your controllers and models.

Whenever your Rails application grows, you will eventually end up with bloated models and controllers. Even though Rails is awesome, it often leads you toward putting unnecessary logic in your controllers and models.

**Take the bull by the horns, use ActiveFormObjects, and start cleaning up your mess ! ðŸ’ª**

A few benefits :

- Keep business logic out of the Controller and models
- Add validation support to plain Ruby object using ActiveModel
- Display data validation errors in the form

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_form_objects'
```

Execute

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Then, depending on your usage you may want to create an `app/forms` folder in your Rails application.

You will put all your forms inside of it.

A form is just a class that extends `ActiveFormObjects::Base`.

On top of all its features, `ActiveFormObjects` gives you access to the entire [Active Model](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_model_basics.html) stack.

## The Form layer

![The form layer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FidMe/active_form_objects/master/docs/images/form_layer.png)

A form object can be decoupled into three parts.

- Params filtering and validating
- Any business logic
- Communication with model

Even though it seems to be a lot to handle for a single class, remember that most of it used to be (poorly done) in your controller.

### A basic example

You have a `User` model.
This model has a password field and on creation you want to verify that password and `password_confirm` match.

This logic does not belong to your `User` model.

Indeed, `User` only needs to know that the `User` has a password, furthemore, `User` does not have a `password_confirm` field, so you would need to add attr_accessor and custom validation into your `User` model.

Seems a bit to much to handle for a `User` model that is also used in a thousand other use cases...

`ActiveFormObjects` allows you to refactor this logic and put it where it belongs.

In this case :

```ruby
class RegistrationController
  def create
    RegistrationForm.new(params).save!
  end
end

class RegistrationForm < ActiveFormObjects::Base
  resource User
  attributes :email, :password, :password_confirm
  validate :confirmation_match

  def confirmations_match
    errors.add(:password, "must match password_confirm") if password != password_confirm
  end
end

class User
  validates :email, :password, presence: true
end
```

### Another example

Another great example where a `FormObject` becomes necessary is when you have several ways to create or update a model.

A typical use case would be as follow :

![form example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FidMe/active_form_objects/master/docs/images/registration_example.png)

In the above example, you have two distinct ways of creating your User.

Therefore you need distinct validations to handle those cases, and your model must not handle them.

## Usage

Using a declarated form is very simple.
Consider this form :

```ruby
class ExampleForm < ActiveFormObjects::Base
  resource Example
  attributes :name

  before_save :capitalize_name

  def capitalize_name
    name.capitalize!
  end
end
```

You have two ways of using it :

**Without resource**

```ruby
form = ExampleForm.new(name: 'Michael')

# Will create an instance of Example
@user = form.save!
# => Example#{ name: 'Michael' }
```

**With resource**

```ruby
form = ExampleForm.new({ name: 'Nicolas' }, @user)

# Will update the given resource
form.save!
# => Example#{ name: 'Nicolas' }
```

Note that you can of course override the `save!` method

```ruby
class ExampleForm < ActiveFormObjects::Base
  def save!
   # do nothing
  end
end
```

The provided `save!` method is just a helper that does

- validate!
- Uses ActiveRecord::Base.transaction
- Returns the resource
